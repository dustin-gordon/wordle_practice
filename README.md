# wordle_practice
A word guessing game based on the popular game Wordle, but with unlimited guesses for the sake of practice.
The rules are simple. You must guess 5 letter words to discover letters in the secret word.
You will win the game once you guess the complete secret word.
There are no repeating letters in the secret word. All 5 letters are unique.
